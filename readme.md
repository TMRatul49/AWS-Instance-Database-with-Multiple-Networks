#🚀 AWS Instance & Database with Multiple Networks <br>
📌 Project Overview <br>
This project investigates the strategic deployment of AWS instances and databases across multiple networks to enhance security, performance, and resource isolation. By leveraging Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), security groups, and network access control lists (NACLs), we explore best practices for optimizing cloud networking.<br>
The project also analyzes network design strategies such as VPC Peering, Transit Gateway, and VPN connections, ensuring scalable, cost-effective, and secure AWS deployments. <br>

🔥 Features <br>
✔️ Enhanced Security – Network isolation minimizes unauthorized access. <br>
✔️ Performance Optimization – Segregating networks improves data flow and speed. <br>
✔️ Resource Isolation – Separation of development, testing, and production environments. <br>
✔️ Compliance Adherence – Ensures data security and meets regulatory requirements. <br>
✔️ Flexible Network Design – Supports VPC Peering, Transit Gateway, and VPNs. <br>
✔️ Cost Efficiency – Optimized cloud architecture reduces overhead expenses. <br>

🎯 Objectives <br>
🔹 Security Enhancement: Strengthen security using AWS VPC, Security Groups, and NACLs. <br>
🔹 Performance Optimization: Reduce network congestion and improve application response time. <br>
🔹 Resource Isolation: Ensure stability and fault isolation across multiple environments. <br>
🔹 Compliance Requirements: Meet industry standards by enforcing data separation. <br>
🔹 Network Design Exploration: Evaluate VPC Peering, Transit Gateway, and VPN strategies. <br>

⚙️ Methodology <br>
This project utilizes Terraform, LocalStack, and Docker to deploy and simulate AWS networks locally before deploying them in the cloud.

1️⃣ Install Terraform – Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for cloud automation. <br>
2️⃣ Install Docker – Used to run LocalStack as a local AWS cloud emulator. <br>
3️⃣ Deploy LocalStack – Simulate AWS networking within a Docker container. <br>
4️⃣ Write Terraform Code – Define AWS instances, databases, and networking. <br>
5️⃣ Initialize Terraform – Run terraform init to prepare the deployment environment. <br>
6️⃣ Apply Terraform Configurations – Use terraform apply to provision AWS resources. <br>
7️⃣ Analyze Graph Output – Visualize deployed AWS network architecture. <br>

🛠 Installation & Usage <br>
Prerequisites <br>
🔹Terraform – Download Terraform <br>
🔹Docker – Download Docker <br>
🔹LocalStack – Used for local AWS simulation 
<br>
